This homework helped me learn coding assessment including both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges on the way to become a full-stack web developer. The activities this week help familiarize you with these tests and allow to use the skills covered in this unit, and complete in building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, having a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

The timed code quiz will run once the start button is clicked then a timer starts with a question, when answered another question shows, when answered incorrectly then the time is subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over, when the game is over type initials and save with score.
